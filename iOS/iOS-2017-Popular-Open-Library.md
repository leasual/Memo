33 iOS open source libraries that will dominate 2017.

Hello, iOS developers! My name is Paweł, and I am an independent iOS developer and author of the 🚀 Enter Universe.
Almost two years ago I published 27 iOS open source libraries to skyrocket your development. It is my best story (regarding Medium users reactions) here ever:

If 155 thousand people are concerned enough to break through a wall of text on the Internet to find the best iOS open source libraries, I deliver.
Spying on my GitHub profile I have found over 180 new starred repositories from the time, so it is an excellent occasion to update my Medium content.
Say hello to 33 pods, that will skyrocket your development in 2017. Ignition started.

On the bottom of the story you will find a TL;DR summary list that contains all these libraries, links to them, and CocoaPods names (if available). No need to take notes during the reading. Now let’s go to the business.

    let username = user["name"] as? String {
    // Finally we got the username
}
into this:
let json = JSON(data: dataFromNetworking)
if let userName = json[0]["user"]["name"].string {
  // Now you got your value
}
Optional wrapping is done for you automatically.
